    <!-- (## POINTER EVENTS ##)
        (Bootstrap provides .pe-none and .pe-auto classes to prevent or add element interactions.
        The .pe-none class (and the pointer-events CSS property it sets) only prevents interactions with a pointer (mouse, stylus, touch).
        Links and controls with .pe-none are, by default, still focusable and actionable for keyboard users.
        To ensure that they are completely neutralized even for keyboard users,
        you may need to add further attributes such as tabindex="-1" (to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus)
        and aria-disabled="true" (to convey the fact they are effectively disabled to assistive technologies),
        and possibly use JavaScript to completely prevent them from being actionable.)

        If possible, the simpler solution is:
        * For form controls, add the disabled HTML attribute.
        * For links, remove the href attribute, making it a non-interactive anchor or placeholder link.

    <!-- <div class="container">
        <p>
            <a href="#" class="pe-none" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">This link</a> can not be clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="#" class="pe-auto">This link</a> can be clicked (this is default behavior).
        </p>
        <p class="pe-none">
            <a href="#" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">This link</a> can not be clicked because the <code>pointer-events</code>
            property is inherited from its parent. However, <a href="#" class="pe-auto">this link</a> has a <code>pe-auto</code> class and can be clicked.
        </p>
